The problem

Running queries are not properly distributed across multiple read only slaves.

Repro (10mins)

Insert ~100k records
go install github.com/pinpt/wip/rds-load-test; and time rds-load-test

Start read queries
go test github.com/pinpt/wip/rds-load-test -bench=Queries -benchtime=60m

Confirm that read replica is using up 100% cpu
select * from information_schema.replica_host_status where last_update_timestamp > NOW() - 60;

Wait for replica to start (10mins)

Confirm that both replicas have cpu loaded equally
select * from information_schema.replica_host_status where last_update_timestamp > NOW() - 60;

BUG: the load is not equal the new server is idle while old is 100% loaded
master ~16% slave 1 ~99% slave 2 ~20%  

Confirm that it works if there are 2 slaves at the beginning
No it does not, only one instance is used
The traffic does not seem to get routed to new instances

FIX: cluster package maintains sql.DB internally
